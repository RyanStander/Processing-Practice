Boolean
Datatypes are true and false and can only be those 2.
Byte
Datatypes are 8 bits of information string values from 127 to -128, convenient for sending data to serial 
ports and representing letters in a simpler format.
Char
Datatypes for characters are symols such as A, a and symbols. Can only hold 1 character.
Color
Datatype for storing color values, stores either the numeric values of each color or the hexadecimal 
notation.
Double
Datatype for floating point numbers larger than those that can be stored in a float. 
Has 64bit values which is double the 
amount as a float
Float
A float is a 32-bit values that can be as large as 3.40282347E+38 and as low as -3.40282347E+38.
Int
Datatype for integers, numbers without decimal points.ntegers can be as large as 2,147,483,647 
and as low as -2,147,483,648. 
Long
Datatype for large integers. While integers can be as large as 2,147,483,647 and as low 
as -2,147,483,648 (stored as 32 bits), a long integer has a minimum value 
of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (stored as 64 bits).
